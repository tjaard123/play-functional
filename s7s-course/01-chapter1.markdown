# Getting Started #

Welcome to a small course on FP (Functional Programming) which will provide
you with extra tools to solve problems.

The course will be divided up into different sections, each with a specific
goal in mind - that being said, the course will be refined as we go,
so participation is encouraged.

# Course Outline #

The course outline will be altered as the course progresses, but an outline
of the course is as follows:

*   General introduction

*   What is Functional Programming?

*   Immutable Data Structures

    -    Why?

    -    Cons lists

    -    Pattern matching

    -    Recursion

    -    Trees
